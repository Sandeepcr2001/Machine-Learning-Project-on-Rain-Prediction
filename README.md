# Rain Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether it will rain tomorrow using Machine Learning algorithms. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building with algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost.

## Features

- **Weather Data**: Includes attributes like temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- **Target**: Predicts if it will rain the next day (`1` for Rain, `0` for No Rain).

## Steps

1. Preprocess data (handle missing values, scale features).
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
3. Handle class imbalance using oversampling.
4. Train and evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
